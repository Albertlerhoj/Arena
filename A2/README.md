If you wanna run the code you can go to the terminal and the directory you are looking for is name "A2". Then by typing "dotnet build" and then "dotnet run" the code should run perfectly
I've also uploaded my code to run-autograding-test, by typing "git add ." then "git commit -m "first commit" and "git push".
